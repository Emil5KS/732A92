    "There are currently two versions of Python in common use, Python 2 and Python 3, which are not 100% compatible. Python 2 is slowly being phased out but has a large enough install base to still be relevant. This course uses the more modern Python 3 but while searching for help online it is not uncommon to find help for Python 2. Especially older posts on sources such as Stack Exchange might refer to Python 2 as simply \"Python\". This should not cause any serious problems but keep it in mind whenever googling. With regards to this lab, the largest differences are how `print` works and the best practice recommendations for string formatting."

In R, reading and writing files are usually performed using file type specific functions such as `read.csv` while in Python we usually start with reading standard text files. However, there are lots of specialized functions for different file types in Python as well, especially when using the __[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)__ library which is built around a datatype similar to R DataFrames.
